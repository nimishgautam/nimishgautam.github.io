Github has a fairly strong positive reputation (as of this writing ðŸ™‚)

They also have a feature where they will host a static website for you for free based on the contents of a github repository. By convention, most people use this as a personal blog space, and specifically technical blogs (I think this is a self-selecting mechanism Iâ€™ll talk about later). So...
