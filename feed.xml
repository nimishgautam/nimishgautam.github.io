      For the better part of the last 15 years, Iâ€™ve worked with start-ups and scale-ups in many capacities: co-founder, employee, consultant, advisor, mascot. Ok, maybe not the last one, but you get the idea ðŸ™‚

      KMonad vs QMK

As Iâ€™ve discussed before, qmk is an amazing piece of software designed to program your mechanical keyboard. The problem, of course, is that you have to have a mechanical keyboard to use it.

But, what if, instead, you could run software on your computer itself that would re-interpret keypresses on your regular keyboard to give it some of the â€˜magicâ€™ that QMK has?

Github has a fairly strong positive reputation (as of this writing ðŸ™‚)

They also have a feature where they will host a static website for you for free based on the contents of a github repository. By convention, most people use this as a personal blog space, and specifically technical blogs (I think this is a self-selecting mechanism Iâ€™ll talk about later). So...
